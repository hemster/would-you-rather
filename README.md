# Would You Rather Project

This repo is a project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

It's a web app build with React & Redux. It lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules. It uses a fake API to mock network requrest.

## Project Setup

* clone the Project - `git@github.com:hemster/would-you-rather.git`
